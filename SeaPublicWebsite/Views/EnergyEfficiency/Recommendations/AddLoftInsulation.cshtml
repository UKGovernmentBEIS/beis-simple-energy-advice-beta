                Add some more loft insulation
            </h1>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                Based on the information we have collected; it looks like you have some insulation in your loft but it’s less
                than the recommended amount. It could be worthwhile adding some more
                to bring it up to the recommended thickness of 300mm, or 12 inches.
            </p>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                Adding extra insulation can help trap the heat inside your property so your
                heating doesn’t need to be on as much.
            </p>

            <p class="govuk-inset-text">
                If some of your loft is boarded so that you can store things up there
                you will either need to raise this boarding up and insulate underneath
                it, or leave that part of the loft with thinner insulation.
            </p>
