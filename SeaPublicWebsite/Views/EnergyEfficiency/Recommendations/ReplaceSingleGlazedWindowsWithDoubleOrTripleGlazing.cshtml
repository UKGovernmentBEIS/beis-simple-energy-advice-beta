                Based on the information we have collected; it looks like you have some single glazed windows in your home. Double or
                triple glazed windows are much better at keeping the heat in, so would help
                you keep warm while reducing your heating bills.
            </p>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                The fuel bill savings from replacing windows are unlikely to pay back the full installation cost, 
                but there are other benefits such as reduced maintenance and better sound proofing that may affect your decision.
