            <p class="govuk-body">
                From the information we have it looks like you have a suspended timber floor.
                This means your ground floor is made of wooden floorboards with a gap underneath.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Adding extra insulation can help trap the heat inside your property so your
                heating doesn’t need to be on as much.
            </p>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                Your floor could be insulated by lifting the floorboards, fitting insulation
                between the joists and then putting the floorboards back. This is normally a
                job for a professional installer.

                    You will need to completely empty the rooms that are being insulated, and remove
                    any carpet or other floor covering, before the floor boards can be lifted.
