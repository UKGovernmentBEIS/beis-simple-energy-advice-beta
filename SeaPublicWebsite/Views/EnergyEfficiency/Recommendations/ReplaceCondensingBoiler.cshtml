                Based on the information we have collected, it looks like you have an old gas boiler that may not be operating efficiently. You could consider replacing this with a modern condensing boiler, which will use less gas to provide the same amount of heat, helping to cut your fuel bills and carbon dioxide emissions.
            </p>

            <p class="govuk-inset-text">
                You may well need to fit new or additional controls when you fit a new gas boiler to comply with building regulations. These will help to maximise the system’s efficiency, saving you even more money.
